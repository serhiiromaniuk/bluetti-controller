> Append-only. Never edit a previous entry. Newest at bottom. Keep it factual —
> commands run, evidence, decisions. This is the loop's memory.

> **This is the ONE place per-step detail is written.** `loop/STATE.md` and
> `tasks/INDEX.md` are pointers and change only when the gate verdict changes, a
> decision is made, a carry-forward moves, or a task opens/closes. `loop/where.sh`
> computes step position from `PLAN.md` and the last result from this file's newest
> `## ` heading — so restating an entry in a pointer file is prose every later
> iteration pays to re-read.
>
> **Budget: ≤40 lines per entry** (`make loop-hygiene` warns). Bullets, not
> narrative. Cite a spec/doc section, never re-quote it. Record the decision and
> the evidence, not the reasoning that produced them. The shape below is the shape.

## 2026-10-13 — Task opened
- Folder opened from `tasks/_template/`; BRIEF written from ROADMAP.md §12 M3, RULES.md v0.4 gate, STATE CF-5.
- No PLAN yet (`needs_plan`): the `planner` writes it next iteration, then the `plan-reviewer`.
- reviewer: batched (doc-only BRIEF; reviewed with the PLAN batch before the push).
- Next: PLAN.md via planner + plan-reviewer.
